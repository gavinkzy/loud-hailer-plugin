Personal learning points & some thoughts:
1. There will always be bugs and challenges in this field.
2. It is a constant learning journey.
3. There are always resources available online to assist with the problem at hand.
4. Psychological battle. 
5. Respect everyone in the field. Because what goes around comes around. You never know when someone's code can help you as much as your own code help others.

This little task made me gain commitment that I hadn't get to acquire on my own. It is simply the matter of setting a deadline and 
striving towards it which actually made the difference. I feel that in this project, my personal assessment would be that basic functionality-wise
the objective is attained. However there are still many areas that can be improved, such as security loopholes, good coding practices,
and also UI/UX designs.  We have to work together to bring together the different levels of expertise and also individual talents. In short, it emphasizes 
a fact that humans no matter what have to work together to bring out the best. And the field of technology is no doubt an exciting one since it can be humanity's 
crown as well as basis of innovation and progress.

To close off, I feel there is much to learn and I hope that I can keep going in the moments of despair. Because coding encompasses the extreme two ends of emotions,
either being extremely proud or extremely disappointed. All in all, this little task is no doubt a meaningful one.
